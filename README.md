# CGI_Ai_Experiment_1
This was my first experiment with turning CGI into Ai using a fine-tuned model. To create the data set for the model, I worked with a young artist to hand draw a bunch of images of a character and then I recreated that character in Blender. I created a series of simple animations and used a stable diffusion to turn the frames into the drawn style.
